# Youtube Comments Scraper

#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/CuoQbuAV9bk>


### Description:
The Youtube comment scraper is an API based project created to extract relevent information from the youtube.com about the channel or videos they have posted. It is designed to gather data from youtube api inorder to store it into a csv file for further analysis.
A function in scraper retrieves channel statistics so multiple channels can be compared in terms of performance using subscribers, view count, etc. There were several functions created to gather information from api. Although the seaborn part for visualizaion is not showed here, it was a great way to compare multiple similar channels in terms of comment count, likes, total views, subscriber count and much more. The comment scraping is done by getting video IDs of channel and gathering author as well as the comment they left, this can be benefitial for sentimental analysis which is intend on extending this project further. This can also be used by content creators as well as marketing media to gain meaningful insights. Overall a fun project that taught me about APIs, using Json formats, extracting data, visualization as well as pandas.


### Idea
The primary goal of this project is to automate the process of data collection from YouTube, enabling users to gather important metrics and comments efficiently. The scraper can fetch channel statistics such as subscriber counts, total views, and video counts, as well as user comments, capturing details like author names and comment text.
